              An Update to YANG Module Names Registration
              draft-ietf-netmod-rfc6020-iana-update-latest

Abstract

   This document amends the IANA guidance on the uniqueness of YANG
   module and submodule names.

   The document updates RFC 6020 to clarify how modules and their
   revisions are handled by IANA.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC6020] defines a registry for YANG module and submodule names,
   called "YANG Module Names" [IANA-MOD-NAMES].

   Specifically, IANA considerations to register YANG module and
   submodule names are specified in Section 14 of [RFC6020].  These
   considerations require that all module and submodule names in the
   registry must be unique.  However, the practice followed by IANA is
   not consistent with that guidance.

   This document amends the guidance on the uniqueness of names
   (Section 14 of [RFC6020]) to comply with the IANA practices for
   registering modules and their revisions.

2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  IANA Considerations

3.1.  Update YANG Parameters Registry

   This document requests IANA to update the reference for the "YANG
   Module Names" registry under the "YANG Parameters" registry group
   [IANA-MOD-NAMES] to also list to the RFC number that will be assigned
   to this document.  This update is needed because the procedure in
   this document is authoritative for assigning names in that registry.

3.2.  Revisions of Published Modules

   This document amends the guidance on the uniqueness of names,
   initially defined in Section 14 of [RFC6020], as follows:

   OLD:
      All module and submodule names in the registry MUST be unique.

  
      All XML namespaces in the registry MUST be unique.

   NEW:
      Modules and their revisions are maintained in the registry.

  
      All initial version module and submodule names in the registry
      MUST be unique.

  
      All XML namespaces of initial version modules in the registry MUST
      be unique.

  
      All modules and submodules revisions MUST have the same name as
      the one in the initial version of the module and submodule.

  
      All module revisions MUST have the same XML namespace as the
      initial version of the module.

4.  Operations and Manageability Considerations

   This document aligns an IANA policy with the practice for handling
   YANG module names.  As such, there are no new operations or
   manageability requirements introduced by this document.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document defines an update to an IANA registration procedure
   defined in [RFC6020].  It does not introduce any new or increased
   security risks that need to be discussed.
